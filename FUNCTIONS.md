## Timelion function reference
This document is auto generated from the timelion code. Do not submit pulls against this document. You want to submit a pull against something in the `series_functions/` directory.

### Data sources
Data sources can start a chain, they don't need to be attached to anything, but they still need to start with a `.` (dot). Data retreived from a data source can be passed into the chainable functions in the next section.

#### .es()
Pull data from an elasticsearch instance

Argument | Accepts | Description
--- | --- | ---

offset | *string* | Offset the series retrieval by a date expression. Eg -1M to make events from one month ago appear as if they are happening now

fit | *string* | Algorithm to use for fitting series to the target time span and interval. Available: average, nearest, none, scale  

### Chainable functions
Chainable functions can not start a chain. Somewhere before them must be a data source function. Chainable functions modify the data output directly from a data source, or from another chainable function that has a data source somewhere before it.
