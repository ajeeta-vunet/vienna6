== Installation

Marvel is installed as an Elasticsearch plugin. The plugin must be installed
on *every node in the cluster*. By default, the plugin will store data in the
same Elasticsearch cluster that it is monitoring.

[TIP]
====
If you are monitoring a production cluster we recommend that you send this
data to another cluster that will serve as a _monitoring cluster_.

This will help to prevent a problem in one cluster from impacting the other
cluster. For example, when your production cluster is having trouble you would
like to make sure you can view the Marvel data easily.

=== Simple install

This is simplest way to install and use Marvel. Marvel data will be stored on
the same cluster as the one being monitored and you will be able to access the
Marvel UI from every node. Follow these steps on every node in the cluster:

1. From the Elasticsearch home directory, run:
+
[source,sh]
----------------
bin/plugin -i elasticsearch/marvel/latest
----------------

2. Restart your Elasticsearch node

Once the plugin is installed on all nodes, you can access the Marvel UI by
viewing http://any-server-in-cluster:9200/_plugin/marvel/ with any modern
browser. It may take a minute for the initial data to appear.

A couple of points to consider:

* Since this requires to restart the nodes of your cluster, you might want
  to temporarily {ref}/modules-cluster.html[disable allocations].

* If you run your cluster using a non-standard port, you need to change the
  `marvel.agent.exporter.es.nosts` settings. See <<configuration>>.


=== Installing a secondary Monitoring Cluster

First, prepare the _monitoring cluster_ -- the cluster you will use to store
and analyze Marvel's data. For this example, we will assume two hosts,
`es-mon-1` and `es-mon-2`, are in the monitoring cluster.

==== The monitoring cluster

For each node in the monitoring cluster:


1. Prevent the nodes in the monitoring cluster from generating their own stats,
   by adding the following line to `config/elasticsearch.yml`:
+
[source,yaml]
------------------------
marvel.agent.enabled: false
------------------------

2. Install the plugin. From the Elasticsearch home directory run
+
[source,sh]
----------------
bin/plugin -i elasticsearch/marvel/latest
----------------

3. Restart Elasticsearch


==== The production cluster

1. Tell each node where to send its stats by adding this line to
    `config/elasticsearch.yml:
+
[source,yaml]
------------------------
marvel.agent.exporter.es.hosts: ["es-mon-1:9200","es-mon-2:9200"]
------------------------
+
This line adds two hosts of your monitoring cluster to receive the data, a
primary and a backup.

2. Install the plugin. From the Elasticsearch home directory run
+
[source,sh]
------------------------
bin/plugin -i elasticsearch/marvel/latest
------------------------

3. Restart Elasticsearch


Once the plugin is installed on all nodes, you can access the Marvel UI by
opening this link with any modern browser.

    http://any-server-in-monitoring-cluster:9200/_plugin/marvel/

It may take a minute or two for data to appear.

TIP: You may want to temporarily {ref}/modules-cluster.html[disable shard
allocation] before you restart your nodes to avoid unnecessary shard
reallocations during the install process.
