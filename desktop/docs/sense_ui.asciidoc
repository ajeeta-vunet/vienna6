== The Sense UI

In this section you will find a more detailed description of UI of Sense. The basic aspects of the UI are explained
in the <<introduction>> section.

[[multi-req]]
=== Multiple Requests Support

The Sense editor allows writing multiple request bellow each other. As shown in the <<introduction>> section, you
can submit a request to Elasticsearch by positioning the cursor and using the <<action_menu,Action Menu>>. Similarly
you can select multiple requests in one go:

.Selecting Multiple Requests

Sense will send the request one by one to Elasticsearch and show the output on the right pane as Elasticsearch responds.
This is very handy when debugging an issue or trying query combinations in multiple scenarios.

Selecting multiple requests also allows you to auto format and copy them as cURL in one go.


[[auto_formatting]]
=== Auto Formatting

Sense allows you to auto format messy requests. To do so, position the cursor on the request you would like to format
and select Auto Indent from the action menu:

.Auto Indent a request
image::images/auto_format_before.png["Auto format before",width=500,align="center"]

Sense will adjust the JSON body of the request and it will now look like this:

.A formatted request
image::images/auto_format_after.png["Auto format after",width=500,align="center"]

If you select Auto Indent on a request that is already perfectly formatted, Sense will collapse the
request body to a single line per document. This is very handy when working with Elasticsearch's bulk APIs:

.One doc per line
