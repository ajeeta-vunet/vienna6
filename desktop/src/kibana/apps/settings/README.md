# Settings

The settings application is broken up into three pages: [Indices](#settings-indices), [Advanced](#settings-advanced), and [Object](#settings-objects).

## Indices

The Indices page manages Index Patterns. Index Patterns represent one or more indices in Elasticsearch and track associated meta-data, like field types and pattern interval.

## Advanced

The Advanced page allows modification of individual configuration parameters. Each of the parameters can be tweaked to customize the entire Kibana installation (changes apply to all users).

## Objects

The Objects page manages all of the saved objects except Index Patterns. Today, that includes Dashboards, Visualizations, and Searches. Most apps give you all of the tools needed, but when they fall short you can come here to beat your objects into submission.
