# Kibana Plugins

### Please don't write custom plugins

While Kibana has a directory called plugins, and a way to load plugin-provided modules, the API is perpousfully undocumented as the underlying mechanisms making plugins possible are undocumented and very likely to change.

Also, please keep in mind that, at this time, issues filed to aid in the development of plugins will be closed with a link to this file.
